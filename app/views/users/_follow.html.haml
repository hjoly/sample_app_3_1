/ The following produces HTML of the form:
/ <input id="relationship_followed_id" name="relationship[followed_id]" type="hidden" value="3" />
/ ":remote => true", tells Rails to allow the form to be handled by javascript.
- relationship = current_user.relationships.build(:followed_id => @user.id)
= form_for(relationship, :remote => true) do |f|
  = f.hidden_field :followed_id 
  .actions= f.submit "Follow"
